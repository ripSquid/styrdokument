### 1.4 Scope

The committees whose logo is not based on the chapter's logo, and their material in digital and physical media, are not covered by this memo.

## 2 Logotype

The chapter’s logotype is defined in the Memo for Insignia.

### 2.1 Colorization

The legs of the microchip shall be of the color "kiselblå" (`#44687D`) (see §1.2 in the chapter's bylaws) and the centrum shall have a darker tone of the same color (for example `#262D33`).  
The lightning bolt shall be white (`#FFFFFF`).

In the case that the official emblem cannot be displayed without difficulties there is two monochrome variants of the emblem to use, one white and one black.  
In the monochrome version the legs of the microchip have the same color as the lightning bolt, while the centrum is void of color.  
The monochrome emblems can for example be used in print, on clothes, or posters.

The chapter’s logotype may not be broken apart, and the fully colored logotype may not be colored in any other way, or with other colors than those defined above.  
The monochrome logotypes may be colored in other colors than those defined above, given that all elements of the logotype are of the same color.

### 2.2 Usage

For posters and the like the logotype shall be placed in one of the poster’s corners, in accordance with the provided templates and defined proportions.

If the logotype is used together with THS' logotype, it should be placed in the opposite corner.

Use the monochrome logotypes if the colored logotype is not sufficiently visible against a background.  
When using the monochrome logotypes, the white logotype shall be used if the back-ground is dark, and the black if the background is light.

The distance to other elements must be at least a quarter of the logotype’s width, on all sides.

The chapter's name "Sektionen för Informationsteknik", in English "The Chapter for Information Technology" and the abbreviations "IT-Sektionen" and "IT-Chapter" is allowed to be closer to the logotype, but should be with the distance of b1 (the width of the top triangle or one eight of the logos width).
