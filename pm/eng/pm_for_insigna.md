## 2 Emblem

### 2.1 Official Emblem

TThe chapter’s logotype is distinguished by the letters I and T as two parts of a vertical lightning bolt, where the I is resting on top of the T.

The lone bolt shall be of the color laser violet (`#CC99FF`, see §1.2 in the chapter’s statue). Alternatively the lower part can have a darker tone of the same color (`#443355`).  

In cases where the flash cannot be used without difficulty, it should be encompassed in a 45 degree tilted square that depicts a stylized microchip.  

The legs of the microchip shall be of the color laser violet (`#CC99FF`, see §1.2 in the chapter’s statutes) and the center shall have a darker tone of the same color (`#443355`). The lightning bolt shall be white (`#FFFFFF`).

### 2.2 Monochrome Emblem

In the case when the official emblem can not be displayed without difficulties there is a monochrome emblem to use, for example for use on clothes or posters.  
In the monochrome version the microchip's legs have the same color as the lightning bolt, while the centrum is void of color.

Below is an example in black (`#000000`).
