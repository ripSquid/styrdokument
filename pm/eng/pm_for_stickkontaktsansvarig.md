In order to pass a revision of this memo, a decision has to be made with a qualified majority at two subsequent chapter meetings.

The Stickkontaktsansvarig is elected by the chapter meeting.

If the chapter meeting finds it very well justified, it may elect additional Stickkontaktsansvariga for the same operational year.

## 3 Activities
A Stickkontaktsansvarig has no formal responsibilities within the chapter's operations, but is encouraged to take responsibility for the wellbeing of the chapter's electrical plugs, extension cords and power strips.

## 4 Regulations
The position of Stickkontaktsansvarig is a honorary position, and should therefore be elected from those who have been involved and furthered the development of the chapter.

A person holding the position of Stickkontaktsansvarig shall hold no other elected position within the chapter.
